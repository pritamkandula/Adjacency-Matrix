"""
    Problem Statment : Understanding of Adjacency Matrix

    In graph theory and computer science, an adjacency matrix is a square
    matrix used to represent a finite graph.
    The elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are
    adjacent(connected) or not in the graph.

    FOR EXAMPLE : We are told that their are 6 friends and
                 and we want to analyse the connection among this friends.
                 This can be done by genrating the adjacency matrix formed
                 by the connection between this friends .
